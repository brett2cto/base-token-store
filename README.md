# Base Token Store on Base

Welcome to Base Token Store, a revolutionary way to buy and manage your tokens on Coinbase's L2 blockchain, Base. Our app operates like a traditional e-commerce store, enabling users to add tokens to their cart and checkout in a single transaction thanks to the advanced batch transaction features of Coinbase smart wallets. Additionally, users can leverage their Coinbase balances onchain, making the process seamless and efficient.

## Demo

Check out our demo video to see the app in action:

## Inspiration

Smart wallets are changing the way users interact onchain. This is a brand new way of thinking about buying tokens using smart wallets!
